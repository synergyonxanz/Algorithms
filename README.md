## üìä Algorithms Overview

### üî¢ Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order. Here are some implementations you will find in this repository:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that is efficient for large datasets.
- **Merge Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that is stable and works well for linked lists.

### üîç Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms help find specific elements within a dataset. Key implementations include:

- **Linear Search**: A straightforward method that checks each element sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays.

### üìà Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Implementations include:

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Calculating Fibonacci numbers using memoization.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Solving the 0/1 knapsack problem with optimal substructure.

### üåê Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms deal with problems related to graph structures. Some key implementations are:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A traversal method that explores as far as possible along each branch.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A traversal method that explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on.

### üí° Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. Implementations include:

- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: A method for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Another approach to finding the minimum spanning tree.

### üß© String Matching

String matching algorithms are used to find occurrences of a substring within a string. Key implementations include:

- **Naive String Matching**: A simple approach that checks all possible positions.
- **KMP Algorithm**: A more efficient algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to skip unnecessary comparisons.
